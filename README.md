This repository contains a [Playnite 8+](https://playnite.link) plugin to
back up your save data using [Ludusavi](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi).

## Features
* Known save locations for more than 8,000 games.
* On-demand backup and restore for all saves.
* Automatically back up a game when you finish playing it.

The [info on what to back up](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-manifest)
is ultimately sourced from [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home),
so please contribute any new or fixed data back to the wiki itself, and your
improvements will be incorporated into Ludusavi's data as well.

## Setup
### Ludusavi
Refer to the [Ludusavi project](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi)
for instructions on how to install Ludusavi itself. You'll need Ludusavi
version 0.7.0 or newer.

By default, the plugin will look for the Ludusavi executable in your `PATH`
environment variable, but you can also configure the plugin with the full
path to the executable.

### Plugin
You can download the plugin from the
[releases page](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite/releases).
There are two ways to install it:

* Using the `*.pext` file:
  * Download `ludusavi-playnite-v*.pext`
  * Drag and drop the file into Playnite
* Using the `*.zip` file:
  * Download `ludusavi-playnite-v*.zip`
  * Extract it into a subfolder of the Playnite extensions directory
    (e.g., `C:/Users/<YOUR_NAME>/AppData/Local/Playnite/Extensions/Ludusavi`)

### Configuration
The plugin provides some of its own configuration (see the screenshots below),
but you'll also need to open Ludusavi to configure it as needed. For example,
at this time, the plugin is not able to tell Ludusavi about your Playnite
library sources, so you'll need to configure Ludusavi's roots separately.

If there are games that you never want to back up after playing, you can tag
them as `ludusavi-skip` to disable the post-game prompt. However, they will
still be included if you do a full backup of all games from the menu.

## Other notes
* The backup and restore operations run in the background after you start them.
  You'll get a notification in Playnite when they finish. If you try to start
  another operation before the first one finishes, you'll have to wait.
* When processing a single game, the plugin will first ask Ludusavi to look it
  up by name. Sometimes, that can fail since Playnite and Ludusavi don't always
  use the same names, so if Ludusavi doesn't recognize it, and if the game is
  from Steam, then the plugin will ask again with the game's Steam ID.
  If that fails too, then you'll get a notification that no data was found.

  This also applies to the "selected games" context menu option.
  However, it does not apply to the "all games" main menu option.
* For backups, the plugin always sets Ludusavi's `--merge` flag. This way,
  if you back up saves for one game, it will not interfere with any backups
  you may have for another game.
* Only one set of save backups is kept for each game. If you decide that
  you'd like to archive a particular set of backups, simply copy them to an
  external drive or cloud storage.
* Although Ludusavi only knows about PC games by default, you can add custom
  entries in Ludusavi for non-PC games if you'd like. The plugin provides a
  setting to either look up those custom entries by the game's name on its own
  or with a suffix, in case you need multiple custom entries for the same game
  name on different platforms.

  Within the suffix, you can write `<platform>` and it will be replaced by
  the actual platform name. For example, if you enable the default suffix and
  you'd like a custom entry for `Some Game` on Nintendo 64, then in Ludusavi
  you would create a custom entry called `Some Game (Nintendo 64)`.
* If you want a single custom entry for all games on a particular non-PC platform
  (such as when all of the saves for that platform are in a single memory card file),
  you can enable the "back up save data by platform name" setting. You will just need
  to create a custom entry in Ludusavi with the same name as the platform.
